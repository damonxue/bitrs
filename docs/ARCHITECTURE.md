# BitRS Architecture

## Overview
BitRS is a distributed exchange built on Solana with cross-chain capabilities. The system consists of four main components:

```
bitrs/
├── backend/      # Rust-based API server
├── frontend/     # Next.js web interface
├── programs/     # Solana smart contracts
└── relayer/      # Cross-chain message relayer
```

## Core Components

### Smart Contracts
- **DEX Core**: Order matching and execution
- **Liquidity Pools**: AMM functionality
- **Staking**: Token staking and rewards
- **Bridge**: Cross-chain asset transfers

### Backend Services
- Order processing with MEV protection
- AMM swap routing
- Cross-chain transaction validation
- Analytics and monitoring

### Frontend
- Trading interface
- Liquidity provision
- Bridge operations
- Analytics dashboard

### Relayer
- Cross-chain message validation
- Transaction monitoring
- State synchronization
- Security checks

## Security Features

### MEV Protection
- Time-weighted order batching
- Randomized execution
- Minimum order values
- Pattern detection

### Cross-chain Security
- Multi-signature validation
- Transaction verification
- Rate limiting
- Suspicious activity monitoring

## Performance Optimizations

### Order Processing
- Batch processing
- Efficient queue management
- Optimized matching algorithm

### State Management
- In-memory caching
- Efficient data structures
- Optimized database queries

## Monitoring & Analytics

### System Metrics
- Transaction volume
- Pool liquidity
- Gas usage
- Error rates

### User Analytics
- Trading activity
- Liquidity provision
- Rewards distribution
- Cross-chain transfers
